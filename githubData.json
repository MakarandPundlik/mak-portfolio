      "description": "PackTravel is a web and mobile application designed to facilitate off-campus travel for university students. It aims to bridge the gap between on-campus transportation (e.g., Wolfline) and the need for longer-distance or flexible travel options by providing access to cabs, rental cars, and ride-sharing services. The platform ensures affordability, convenience, and user-friendly accessibility for students without personal vehicles.",
